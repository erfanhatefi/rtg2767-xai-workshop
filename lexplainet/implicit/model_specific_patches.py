"""
This module contains the model-specific patches for the LRP implementation.
These patches are designed to handle specific layers or operations in certain
models that require special treatment for LRP. For example, in transformer-based models,
we need to patch the attention mechanism to apply the uniform rule in matmul operations
via the Gradient*Input framework. Similarly, for ResNet models, we need to canonize the
Conv2d and BatchNorm2d layers to ensure that the relevance scores are correctly propagated
through these layers. The functions in this module are responsible for applying these patches
to the respective layers or operations in the models.
